- why are we using sudo , for renice and -ve values ??

- why are we using sudo, for chrt and real-time policies and 
  priorities ??

- let us understand some background details and practical 
  aspects ??

   - whenever we login using a login id/user id, 
     all processes of our sessions, including shell 
     are assigned our login id /user id ??
     - processes are assigned user-id or login-id 
       credentials 
     - as per the process login-id/ credentials, 
       each process has certain privileges ??? 
       - a normal user processes will have 
         normal privileges ??? can use +ve 
         values of nice priority and cannot 
         use -ve values - in addition, cannot 
         use chrt and realtime policies/priorties ??

       - a super-user/root user can set +ve / -ve 
         nice priorities, as well use chrt, for 
         real-time policies/priorities ??

       - if we are given sudo access, we will be 
         able to use +ve and -ve nice values, as well
        as chrt and real-time scheduling - why is this 
        so ?? 

           - when we execute sudo renice -n -10 <pid>, 
             the process executing renice will be 
             assigned super-user id , which enables 
             privileged access - once the command / 
             process completes, we work, with normal 
             id and privileges ???

    - what is the use of su ???

        - fundamentally, su is switch user command - 
          it can be used, for switching to any user, 
          including super-user/root, if we can 
          authenticate , with the target user's 
          passwd/key 

         - we must use such user switching, with 
           care and responsibility ??

     - for every user, there is an user-id and 
       one or more group ids 

     - typically, privileges are provided to a user/login, 
       based on user-id, but in some cases, group id(s) 
       can be used 

     - in the case of files, certain users may belong to 
       a group and these users/processes are allowed to 
       access certain files, based on their group and 
       group permissions of target files 

     - in certain cases, a group of users may be assigned to 
       a group/group id and provided a common set of 
       privileges - for instance, a group of users may be 
       assigned to a "sudo"  group and this group may be 
       assigned sudo access 

      - ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd,stat >  ps.txt 
             - the above command is acceptable 

      - ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd,stat > while1.c 
             - the above command is unacceptable 
             - it will destroy the contents of our 
               program file ??
