- shell is a non-core system utility, which is used 
  as a CLI 
- shell works, with terminals - there are different terminals 
  - for instance, there are text terminals - there are 
    graphical user terminals - these are implemented differently, 
    but their jobs is to provide interface to user-input and 
    output information to the user 
  - for supporting graphical terminals, we may use a terminal 
    emulator utility, which manages certain terminals or 
    terminal server, which again manages certain terminals 
  - there are several low-level details, for managing 
    terminals, in the system space - OS provides a good 
    abstraction, which also, provides abstract interfaces to 
    the shell and other commands 
  - refer to the diagrams 
  - check the set-up, in practical systems 
  - in a practical set-up, check the parent process of a shell 
    - in the case of graphical terminals, it will be the 
      terminal emulator process or terminal server process 
  - there are different implementations of shells, which have 
    different features 
  - oldest shell may be Bourne shell, the original Unix shell 
  - korn shell, which is the improvised version of Bourne shell
  - in addition, there is a csh, which was provided, in certain 
    Unix versions, like BSD/freeBSD
  - in addition, bash shell is also implemented, as part of 
    GNU project - this shell is used widely, in Linux systems
